# Rocket-Sim

This is a simple rocket simultion I am building for my A Level Computing Non-Exam Assessment.

I am aiming to create a site that allows a simulated rocket launch to take place based on a number of input parameters. I should be able to get the rocket into a stable orbit


For testing UI design the simulaion data is disabled. To enable this uncomment the function call in `findOrbitHeight()` Data can be viewed in the console.

## To Do

- Make backend DB interaction work
- Create a trajectory line the curves round the Earth
- Use Google's OAuth service for authentication
- Improve the physics simulation accuracy
